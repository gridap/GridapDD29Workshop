# Introduction to Gridap: Simulating PDEs using finite elements in Julia

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the webpage of Gridap's workshop at DD29!

* **Where?** [Room T01, Building 13, PoliMi Campus, Milan](https://www.dd29.polimi.it/venue/).
* **When?** [Sunday 22nd June, 2025, 11.30-15 (with lunch break)](https://www.dd29.polimi.it/courses/).

## Workshop description

This short workshop will showcase the main features of [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl), an ecosystem of software packages for the simulation of problems governed by PDEs written in the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org/).

Gridap has a very expressive user interface, allowing one to solve complex PDE systems by stating the problem using whiteboard notation. It implements multiple state-of-the-art finite element methods that can efficiently exploit large-scale HPC supercomputers.

The workshop will be tutorial-based and will cover the main features of Gridap and its application to several problems.

The emphasis will be mainly on presenting the main software abstractions underlying these packages and how these can be combined to solve a variety of PDEs with application to different problems in science and engineering.  The choice of the PDE systems to be discussed in the workshop will be based on the participant's interests gathered during registration.  

**Participants must bring their own laptops**. Instructions to install the software are available in [Software installation](@ref). **These should
be followed before the actual workshop takes place.**
